Problem  :: 3192. Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One II
You are given a binary array  nums.

You can do the following operation on the array any number of times (possibly zero):

Choose any index i from the array and flip all the elements from index i to the end of the array.
Flipping an element means changing its value from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in nums equal to 1

Time Complexity :: O(N)
Space Complexity :: O(1)

Code :: 
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int cnt = 0 ;
        int times =0;
        for(int i=0 ; i<nums.size() ; i++){
            if((nums[i] == 0 && times%2 == 0) || nums[i]==1 && times%2!=0){
                cnt++;
                times++;
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
